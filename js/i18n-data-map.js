However, before deploying convolutional neural networks, adequate testing must be performed to detect internal flaws, especially in security-sensitive scenarios.

But in reality, when the model under test is a black-box CNN model with no access to internal information, it is still necessary in some cases to generate high-quality test inputs within a limited testing budget. In this new situation, one possible approach is to generate transferable test inputs by analyzing the internal knowledge of other white-box CNN models similar to the model under test, and then use the transferable test inputs to test the black-box CNN model. The main challenge in generating transferable test inputs is how to improve their error-inducing capabilities for different CNN models without changing the test oracle. We found that different CNN models make predictions based on features of similar important regions in the image. Adding targeted perturbations to important regions will generate transferable test inputs with a high degree of realism.","可信人工智能":"Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence","兰文尉":"Lan Wenwei","李静雯":"Li Jingwen","李莉":"Li Li","李铮":"Li Zheng","廖富威":"Liao Fuwei","林高毅":"Lin Gaoyi","刘诗凡":"Liu Shifan","刘硕":"Liu Shuo","刘志伟":"Liu Zhiwei","漏洞检测是保护软件系统免受网络攻击的一个重要方面。然而，有些类型的漏洞很难检测，需要从多个角度分析源代码。为此，我们提出了一个通用且易于扩展的框架，即 SGVD（用于漏洞检测的顺序图注意力网络）。":"Vulnerability detection is an important aspect of protecting software systems from cyberattacks.

Existing mutation prompt methods generally have limitations.

Existing smart contract vulnerability detection methods usually rely on extracting control flow graphs, function call graphs, or abstract syntax trees from source code or bytecode to characterize the semantic and syntactic characteristics of the contract.

However, DNN, like traditional software, inevitably has defects. If a defective DNN model is applied to safety-critical fields, it may even cause serious accidents.
